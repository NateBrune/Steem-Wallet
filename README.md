### A chrome extension to keep your keys safe!

## What is Steem Wallet
Steem Wallet is a chrome extension designed to protect users and prevent broken hearts.  Steem Wallet will store your keys safe and sound inside itself. When you want to find out the key you need to login to a new steem service, you can just use Steem Wallet to figure it out. No longer do you need to login to steemit.com, go to permission, login, view private key. This tool will save you time!

## Notes
The private key functionality of this wallet is not implemented yet. I am currently talking to svk to get it working. In the future, I plan on using this extension as a way to login to websites. Any pull requests with merrit will be merged. Thank you everyone for following my work and supporting me!
